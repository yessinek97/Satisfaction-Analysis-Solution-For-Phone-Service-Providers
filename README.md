# Satisfaction-Analysis-Solution-For-Phone-Service-Providers
This is a sentimental analysis project that aims to provide a better insight on customers' satisfaction based on comments gathered (scrapped) from social media using google's Bert classification model. We focused on the main 3 spoken dialects in tunisia: French, English and tunisian. So by the end of this work we should have three classifiers, one for each dialect.

# How to run

The execution requires having all files under the provided folder named 'files' placed under users/maily or users/'username'.
we've devided the code into 3 notebooks, one for each dialect: final_bert_transfer_learning-english.ipynb, final_bert_transfer_learning-french.ipynb and final_bert_transfer_learning-tunisien.ipynb.

DataEnoding.ipynb and answersGenerator.ipynb are related to the next part for which we needed to have our dataset restructured into a data warehouse to later feed it to PowerBI for analytical purposes.
